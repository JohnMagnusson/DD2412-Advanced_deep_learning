# DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning
This project was made for course DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning KTH.
In this project we aim to reproduce the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/simclr">SimCLR framework</a> made by google, but with some limitations due time constrains.<br>
Extension to the paper was done which is hown in the following list: 
<ul>
<li>Trying a new augmentation strategy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719">RandAugment</a>.</li>
<li>Experiment with an alternative Lifted structure loss function.</li>
<li>Comparison with a new state-of-the-art model <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733">BYOL</a>.</li>
</ul>
